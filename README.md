Hi!

This project was originally started on my work computer and developed in bitbucket.
You can check the screenshot I left among other Sudoku Solver files to see that it was a *PROCESS*.
I decided to move it here as an archive of what I trained in the past, but I will not be amending the files to
imitate the CI/CD process I had attempted in BitBucket. I believe this project has served its purpose as a
training grounds, and the time has come to let it rest in the archives. 

Thank you for taking interest :)
